# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added `loop: unlimited` (and `loop: true`) frontmatter for open-ended loops that run until convergence, user interrupt, or the 999-iteration safety cap.
- Added model rotation for loop iterations via `rotate: true` frontmatter. Cycles through comma-separated models and thinking levels each iteration instead of using fallback semantics.

### Changed
- Unlimited loops (`--loop` bare or `loop: unlimited`) no longer force convergence on. Convergence follows the `converge` field like bounded loops. Safety cap raised from 50 to 999.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- Added delegated chain-step context summaries via `chainContext: summary` (chain frontmatter), `/chain-prompts ... --chain-context` (command-level), and per-step `--with-context` (single delegated chain steps).

## [0.6.4] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- Updated skill command resolution to use `sourceInfo.path` instead of the removed `path` field on `SlashCommandInfo`, fixing compatibility with pi-coding-agent 0.62.0 source provenance changes.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- Chain step progress now shows in the status bar (e.g., `step 2/3: simplify`) and persists until the chain completes, instead of only appearing as a notification that scrolls away.
- Added `parallel(...)` chain step support for delegated prompt templates, including parser/frontmatter validation, delegated task fan-out, aggregated result rendering, and per-task progress display.

### Fixed
- Delegated subagent errors now show as clean notifications instead of extension crash messages with stack traces, matching how other validation errors (missing skill, missing template, etc.) are presented.
- When no subagent bridge is listening (extension not loaded, name collision with another extension), delegation now fails immediately with a diagnostic message instead of silently waiting 15 seconds before timing out.
- Timeout error message no longer dumps the full rendered prompt content; uses the agent name instead.
- Parallel delegated status now prefers aggregate `parallel X/Y running` updates over first-task tool labels, avoiding misleading `running <tool>` status lines during multi-task execution.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- Added delegated-subprocess working directory controls via `cwd` frontmatter (for `subagent` prompts and chain-template defaults) plus runtime `--cwd=<path>` overrides.

### Fixed
- Rewrote README for clarity: fixed default subagent name (`delegate`, not `worker`), corrected provider priority to include `openai-codex`, merged broken frontmatter table into grouped sections with readable descriptions, cut redundant examples, and tightened prose throughout.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- Added delegated prompt execution via direct extension event bus communication with `subagent` (`prompt-template:subagent:*` channels), including delegated custom-message persistence for loop summaries and context carry-forward.
- Added prompt frontmatter support for `subagent` and `inheritContext`, with `inheritContext: true` mapped to delegated fork context.
- Fork context preamble is handled by the subagent extension directly (via `DEFAULT_FORK_PREAMBLE` in `types.ts`), applying to all fork-context subagent runs universally.
- Added runtime delegation override flags: `--subagent`, `--subagent=<name>`, and `--subagent:<name>`.
- Added live progress widget above editor during delegated subagent runs showing elapsed time, tool count, tokens, current tool, and task preview — matching the native subagent tool card layout.
- Added styled completion card with task preview, tool call history, expandable output (Ctrl+O), and usage stats footer.

### Changed
- Updated provider priority for ambiguous bare model IDs to prefer `openai-codex` before `anthropic`, `github-copilot`, and `openrouter`.
- Updated loop convergence and fresh-summary analysis to account for delegated subagent message payloads.

### Fixed
- Delegated start-time hangs now fail fast with explicit timeout errors when a subagent run never emits a start signal.
- Delegated runs no longer treat arbitrary escape-sequence-bearing terminal input as an Esc cancellation signal; only literal Esc cancels.
- Chain and loop restore paths now use live runtime model/thinking state during cleanup, preventing skipped restore on mid-step failures.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

- Clarified the README chain examples so the optional ` -- ` shared-args separator is clearly distinct from loop flags like `--loop`, `--fresh`, and `--no-converge`.
- Clarified in the README that chain frontmatter declarations support per-step `--loop N` inside the `chain:` value.
- Argument substitution now accepts `@$` as an alias for `$@` for compatibility with commonly-typed placeholder variants.
- Skill injection now uses a next-turn context message from `before_agent_start` instead of mutating the turn system prompt.
- Non-chain templates can now omit `model` and inherit the current session model, so inline `<if-model ...>` rendering and skill injection still work without explicit model frontmatter.
- Chain steps without `model` now inherit a fixed chain-start model snapshot, so model-less chain steps behave as if that model were declared in frontmatter while remaining deterministic across step switches.

### Fixed

- Chain step execution now avoids implicit previous-step model bleed for model-less templates by resolving them against the chain-start model snapshot instead of whichever model was active after the prior step.
- Model-less prompt loading now skips plain templates that do not use extension features, preventing command collisions with other extension commands like `/review` and `/handover`.
- Model-less prompt loading now also ignores no-op/invalid-only extension metadata (for example `restore`-only or invalid loop flags), so ineffective frontmatter does not unnecessarily claim command names.
- Model-less prompt loading now recognizes invalid conditional closers like `</else>` as extension-relevant markup, so those templates stay in this extension path and surface proper conditional-parse warnings instead of silently bypassing extension handling.
- Model-less prompt execution now tracks runtime model changes (`model_select` + internal switches/restores) and uses that tracked model instead of potentially stale command-context snapshots.
- Prompt commands now fail fast when a configured `skill` file is missing or unreadable, instead of silently sending the prompt without skill context.
- Skill resolution now returns a typed success/error outcome that callers handle explicitly, rather than emitting notifications from inside the resolver and returning sentinel `null` values.
- Session start/switch now clear any queued skill context message so stale pending skill payloads cannot leak across session boundaries.
- Session start/switch now also clear pending single-command restore state (`previousModel`/`previousThinking`) so restore writes cannot leak into a different session.
- Skill frontmatter resolution now checks registered skill commands first (`pi.getCommands()` skill entries), accepts both `<name>` and `skill:<name>` values, searches additional standard pi skill locations (`.agents/skills` in project ancestors and `~/.agents/skills`), supports direct `<skill>.md` files alongside `SKILL.md` directories, and rejects traversal-like skill names for path fallback.
- `extractLoopCount()` now strips repeated unquoted `--loop` tokens once looping is active, preventing stray loop flags from leaking into prompt arguments.
- Chain frontmatter step parsing now strips repeated per-step `--loop` tokens once a valid per-step loop is resolved, and keeps the first valid value (including mixed invalid/valid numeric sequences like `--loop 1000 --loop 2`).
- Loop-mode restore now tracks runtime model/thinking state per iteration instead of relying on command-context model snapshots, so model restoration remains correct even when command context values are stale.
- Chain execution now restores model/thinking state in a `finally` path, so restore still runs after unexpected runtime errors during a chain step and chain cleanup state is still reset even when restore itself fails.
- Loop and chain executions no longer report `Loop finished`/`Loop converged` when runtime errors abort execution mid-loop.
- Loop and chain error propagation now preserves thrown falsy values (for example `throw 0`) instead of treating them as success, preventing swallowed errors and false completion notifications.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- Loop execution via `--loop` flag: `--loop N`, `--loop=N` to run a prompt N times (1-999), or bare `--loop` for unlimited until convergence with a 50-iteration safety cap. Bare `--loop` always forces convergence on.
- Frontmatter loop controls: templates can now set `loop: N` (1-999) and `converge: false` defaults; CLI `--loop` overrides frontmatter `loop`, and `--no-converge` disables convergence for bounded loops.
- Convergence detection: loops stop early when an iteration makes no file changes (`write`/`edit`). Enabled by default; `--no-converge` opts out.
- Fresh context mode: `--fresh` flag or `fresh: true` frontmatter collapses conversation between loop iterations, keeping only accumulated summaries. Saves tokens on long loops.
- Loop iteration context injected into the system prompt so the agent builds on previous work across iterations.
- Loop progress indicator in the TUI status bar.
- `run-prompt` agent tool: the agent can run prompt templates, chains, and loops on its own. Opt-in via `/prompt-tool on [guidance]`. Config persists in `~/.pi/agent/prompt-template-model.json`.
- Chain templates: new `chain` frontmatter field to declare reusable template pipelines (`chain: double-check --loop 2 -> deslop --loop 2`). Per-step `--loop N` loops each step independently. No `model` required — each step uses its own. Supports `loop`, `fresh`, `converge`, `restore` for overall execution control. Chain nesting is rejected at runtime.

### Fixed

- `readSkillContent` no longer swallows read errors. The caller now sees the actual error message (e.g., permission denied) instead of a generic "Failed to read skill" notification.
- `restoreSessionState` no longer clears `pendingSkill` as a side effect unrelated to model/thinking restoration.
- Error diagnostics now consistently use `String(error)` instead of hardcoded fallback strings.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- Inline `<if-model is="...">...</if-model>` blocks with optional `<else>` branches inside prompt bodies.
- Provider wildcard matching in conditionals with syntax like `anthropic/*`.
- Conditional rendering now happens after model fallback resolution for both single prompt commands and `/chain-prompts`.
- Prompt argument substitution now mirrors pi core more closely, including `${@:N}` and `${@:N:L}` slice syntax. See README for full placeholder reference.

### Fixed

- Model fallback now preserves the currently active model whenever it matches any listed fallback candidate, including ambiguous bare model IDs that would otherwise resolve through provider preference, instead of switching to an earlier candidate unnecessarily.
- Prompt templates that collide with reserved slash commands, including built-ins like `/model` and the extension’s own `/chain-prompts`, are now skipped with a warning instead of being silently shadowed.
- Prompt discovery is now deterministic in a locale-independent way, and duplicate model-enabled prompt names within the same source layer are skipped with a warning instead of silently depending on traversal order.
- Invalid `model` frontmatter declarations are now rejected during prompt loading with diagnostics instead of failing later at execution time.
- Literal tags like `<elsewhere>` and `</if-modeling>` no longer get misparsed as malformed conditional directives.
- Non-interactive notifications now go to stderr so print-mode stdout stays clean.
- Bare model IDs with multiple providers can now still resolve through OAuth-backed auth checks even when fast availability checks alone are inconclusive.
- Optional string frontmatter fields are now trimmed so quoted values like `thinking: " high "` and `skill: " tmux "` behave as expected.
- Existing prompt commands now refresh prompt files before execution, so edits made during a session take effect on the next run instead of waiting for a new session.
- Skill-loaded custom messages now fail safe if their details payload is missing instead of crashing the renderer.
- Frontmatter `model` specs and inline conditional `is` specs now reject internal whitespace like `anthropic /model` or `anthropic /*` instead of silently registering values that can never match.
- Recursive prompt discovery now detects already-visited directories and skips symlink loops instead of risking infinite recursion or duplicate traversal.
- Bare model IDs now honor provider priority across all auth-capable candidates, including OAuth-backed providers, instead of incorrectly favoring a lower-priority provider just because it appeared in the fast-available set.
- Prompt loading now rejects non-object YAML frontmatter roots, like lists, with a diagnostic instead of silently treating them as missing `model` fields.
- `/chain-prompts` now only restores model and thinking when they actually changed, avoiding redundant state writes and noisy restore notifications on no-op chains.
- `/chain-prompts` now tracks thinking changes caused by model switches even when a step does not set `thinking`, so final restoration stays correct when the runtime clamps or resets thinking during a model change.
- `/chain-prompts` now rejects empty or quote-only step segments explicitly instead of treating them as blank template names.
- Single-command auto-restore now also skips no-op thinking restores and notifications when the runtime is already back on the original thinking level.
- Removed unnecessary exports: `modelSpecMatches` from model-selection.ts and `VALID_THINKING_LEVELS` from prompt-loader.ts are now internal implementation details.
- `/chain-prompts` now correctly ignores ` -- ` and `->` inside quoted per-step arguments instead of misinterpreting them as separators.
- `</else>` is now explicitly rejected with a helpful error message explaining that `<else>` is a separator, not a container.
- Fast-path optimization now correctly includes `</else>` check so standalone invalid tags are caught.
- Empty prompt abort in single-command mode now notifies as "error" instead of "warning" for consistency with chain mode.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed

- Prompts map now initialized at extension load instead of waiting for `session_start`. Commands invoked before the first session event no longer fail with stale empty state.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Chain command**: `/chain-prompts` orchestrates multiple prompt templates sequentially, each with its own model, skill, and thinking level. Conversation context flows between steps naturally.
- Per-step args override shared args: `/chain-prompts analyze "error handling" -> fix-plan "focus on perf" -> summarize -- src/main.ts`
- Mid-chain failure rolls back to the original model and thinking level
- Step progress notifications show which step is running
- State isolation: chain uses local variables, never interferes with single-command restore behavior

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed

- Thinking level now correctly restored after commands that switch model without a `thinking` field. Previously, running a prompt template that only specified `model` would reset thinking to "off" instead of restoring the original level (e.g., "high").

## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-31

### Added

- **Model fallback**: The `model` field now accepts a comma-separated list of models tried in order
- First model that resolves and has auth configured is used
- Supports mixing bare model IDs and explicit `provider/model-id` specs
- If the current model matches any candidate, it's used without switching
- Single consolidated error when all candidates fail
- Autocomplete shows fallback chain with pipe separator: `[haiku|sonnet]`
- Banner image

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-12

### Added

- **Model switching** via `model` frontmatter in prompt templates
- **Print mode support**: Commands work with `pi -p "/command args"` for scripting
- **Thinking level control**: `thinking` frontmatter field with levels `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`
- **Skill injection**: `skill` frontmatter field injects skill content into system prompt via `<skill>` tags
- **Subdirectory support**: Recursive scanning creates namespaced commands like `(user:subdir)`
- **Auto-restore**: Previous model and thinking level restored after response (configurable via `restore: false`)
- **Provider resolution** with priority fallback (anthropic, github-copilot, openrouter)
- Support for explicit `provider/model-id` format
- Fancy TUI display for skill loading with expandable content preview
